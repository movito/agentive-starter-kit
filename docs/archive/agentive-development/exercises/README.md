## How to Use Exercises

### Individual Learning
1. Complete exercises in order (build on previous learning)
2. Spend time on reflection questions (deepen understanding)
3. Try alternative approaches (explore variations)
4. Document your own patterns (capture what works)

### Team Learning
1. Complete exercises individually first
2. Compare approaches in group discussion
3. Review solutions together
4. Adapt patterns for your team context

### Teaching Others
1. Walk through exercises with guidance
2. Let learners struggle appropriately (build problem-solving)
3. Facilitate reflection discussions
4. Connect exercises to real work

## Alternative: Real Project Exercises

Instead of synthetic exercises, apply patterns to your real project:

**Foundation:**
- Take a current feature request → Convert to structured task
- Take existing code → Write tests using TDD approach
- Practice git workflow on real branches

**Augmentation:**
- Submit a real task plan for evaluation
- Triage real evaluation feedback
- Calculate ROI on actual evaluations

**Delegation:**
- Design an agent for a real need in your project
- Write instructions for a tool you actually use
- Define quality gates for your actual work

**Orchestration:**
- Decompose a real epic into parallel work
- Build shared state for your actual agents
- Create a real coordinator for your project

**Systems:**
- Set up CI/CD for your actual repository
- Build metrics dashboard for your real metrics
- Scale your actual agent ecosystem

**Advantage:** Immediate application, real context, measurable outcomes
**Challenge:** More complex than synthetic exercises, requires production system
