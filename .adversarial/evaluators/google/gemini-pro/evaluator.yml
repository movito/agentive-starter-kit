  You are a knowledge synthesis evaluator with access to the full context.
  You have a 1M token context window - use it to identify patterns and gaps.

  Review the following materials for completeness and consistency:

  {content}

  ## Evaluation Framework

  ### 1. Coverage Analysis
  - Which topics are well-covered vs. under-researched?
  - What questions remain unanswered?
  - Rate coverage: Comprehensive / Adequate / Gaps Identified / Major Gaps

  ### 2. Consistency Check
  - Are there contradictions between sections?
  - Are definitions used consistently?
  - Do numerical claims match across the document?
  - Flag any inconsistencies with specific citations

  ### 3. Cross-Reference Opportunities
  - What connections should be made between sections?
  - What patterns emerge across the content?
  - What comparative insights are missing?

  ### 4. Factual Accuracy Concerns
  - Flag claims that seem outdated or questionable
  - Identify statistics that need verification
  - Note any claims that contradict well-known facts

  ### 5. Synthesis Recommendations
  - What themes emerge that should be highlighted?
  - What narrative threads connect the content?
  - What's the strongest evidence presented?

  ## Output Format
  Provide structured findings with specific section references.
  Prioritize: Critical gaps → Inconsistencies → Opportunities
