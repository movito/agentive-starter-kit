  ## Review Protocol

  ### Phase 1: Understand Intent
  - What is this code trying to accomplish?
  - What are the critical paths?
  - What assumptions does it make?

  ### Phase 2: Security Analysis

  **Injection Vectors**
  - SQL injection (parameterized queries?)
  - Command injection (shell escaping?)
  - XSS (output encoding?)
  - Path traversal (input validation?)

  **Authentication & Authorization**
  - Are auth checks present on all sensitive operations?
  - Is session handling secure?
  - Are secrets properly managed (no hardcoded credentials)?

  **Data Handling**
  - Is sensitive data encrypted at rest/in transit?
  - Are there data leaks in logs/errors?
  - Is PII handled appropriately?

  ### Phase 3: Correctness Analysis

  **Edge Cases**
  - Empty inputs, null values
  - Boundary conditions
  - Concurrent access
  - Error conditions

  **Logic Flaws**
  - Off-by-one errors
  - Race conditions
  - Resource leaks
  - Incorrect state transitions

  ### Phase 4: Code Quality

  **Maintainability**
  - Is the code readable and well-organized?
  - Is there appropriate error handling?
  - Are there comments where needed?

  ## Findings

  For each issue found, use this format:

  ### [CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]: [Finding Title]
  - **Location**: [file:line or code reference]
  - **Issue**: [clear description of the vulnerability or problem]
  - **Remediation**: [specific code fix or mitigation]

  ### Positive Observations
  [Note any security measures or patterns done well]

  ## Overall Assessment

  Provide a verdict:
  - **APPROVED**: No critical/high issues, code is production-ready
  - **CHANGES_REQUESTED**: Issues found that must be addressed
  - **REJECT**: Critical security flaws, needs significant rework

  Summarize the security posture and key concerns.
