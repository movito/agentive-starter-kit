# Spec Compliance Check: [TASK-ID] [Task Title]

## Task Specification

Paste the FULL task spec below (from `delegation/tasks/3-in-progress/`).
The evaluator needs every requirement, acceptance criterion, and "must not" constraint.

```markdown
[Full task spec content]
```

## Implementation

### Changed Files

For each new or modified source file, include FULL content.

#### `path/to/file.py`

```python
[Full file content]
```

#### `path/to/other_file.py`

```python
[Full file content]
```

### Test Files

Include the full test file — the evaluator checks that each requirement has a test.

#### `tests/test_feature.py`

```python
[Full test file content]
```

## Handoff Notes (optional)

If there is a handoff file or starter with additional implementation guidance,
include the relevant sections here. The evaluator will cross-reference these
against the implementation.
