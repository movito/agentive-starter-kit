# ANTHROPIC API KEY (Optional for Claude Code users)

# If you're using Claude Code with your claude.ai account, you're already
# authenticated and don't need this key.

# OPENAI API KEY (Required for Adversarial Evaluation)
# ============================================================================

# before implementation. This catches design flaws early.
#
# Cost: ~$0.04-0.08 per evaluation (typically 2-3 evaluations per task)
# Get your key at: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
#
# Without this key, the evaluator won't work, but everything else will.
