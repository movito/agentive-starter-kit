# Agentive Starter Kit - Environment Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your API keys
#
# IMPORTANT: Never commit .env to version control!
# The .gitignore file already excludes it.

# ============================================================================
# ANTHROPIC API KEY (Optional for Claude Code users)
# ============================================================================
# If you're using Claude Code with your claude.ai account, you're already
# authenticated and don't need this key.
#
# Only needed for programmatic API access outside of Claude Code.
# Get your key at: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
#
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here

# ============================================================================
# OPENAI API KEY (Required for Adversarial Evaluation)
# ============================================================================
# The adversarial evaluation system uses GPT-4o to review task specifications
# before implementation. This catches design flaws early.
#
# Cost: ~$0.04-0.08 per evaluation (typically 2-3 evaluations per task)
# Get your key at: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
#
# Without this key, the evaluator won't work, but everything else will.
#
OPENAI_API_KEY=

# ============================================================================
# LINEAR API KEY (Optional - for task synchronization)
# ============================================================================
# Enables two-way sync between your task files and Linear issues.
# Get your key at: https://linear.app/settings/api
#
# Without this key, tasks work perfectly - they just won't sync to Linear.
#
# To sync tasks:
#   ./project linearsync                 # Manual sync
#   (or push to main branch)             # Auto-sync via GitHub Actions
#
LINEAR_API_KEY=

# ============================================================================
# LINEAR TEAM CONFIGURATION (Optional)
# ============================================================================
# How team resolution works:
#   1. If LINEAR_TEAM_ID is set → uses that team
#   2. If LINEAR_TEAM_ID is unset → auto-detects first team in workspace
#
# Accepts THREE formats:
#   - Team KEY: "AL2" (recommended - human-readable)
#   - Team UUID: "89b26800-e1e6-4998-bedf-04195e592cd9"
#   - Empty/unset: Auto-detects first team
#
# For SINGLE-TEAM workspaces:
#   Leave unset (auto-detection works great)
#
# For MULTI-TEAM workspaces:
#   Set to your team's KEY (e.g., "AL2", "ENG", "PROD")
#   To see available teams: ./project linearsync (first run will show detected team)
#
LINEAR_TEAM_ID=

# GitHub repository URL (optional - auto-detected from git remote)
# Used for generating task file links in Linear issues
# Example: https://github.com/yourorg/yourrepo
# GITHUB_REPO_URL=

# ============================================================================
# PROJECT CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================
# These are set during the planner onboarding process

# Your project name (used in configurations)
PROJECT_NAME=

# Project ID prefix for tasks (e.g., "PROJ" creates PROJ-0001, PROJ-0002, etc.)
