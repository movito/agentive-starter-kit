# Adversarial Workflow - API Keys Configuration
# ================================================
#
# This file configures which AI models power your adversarial workflow.
# The workflow uses TWO models for quality assurance:
#
#   1. IMPLEMENTATION Agent: Writes code based on your task
#   2. EVALUATOR Agent: Reviews code for quality and correctness
#
# Why two models? Different perspectives catch more issues!
#
# ================================================
# RECOMMENDED SETUP
# ================================================
#
# Claude Code uses your Anthropic API key automatically.
# Evaluators can use OpenAI, Google, Mistral, or Anthropic.
#
# Run `adversarial list-evaluators` to see available options.

# Anthropic API Key (for Claude agents)
# Get yours at: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
# Starts with: sk-ant-
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key-here

# OpenAI API Key (for built-in evaluators)
# Get yours at: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
# Starts with: sk-proj- or sk-
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here

# ================================================
# OPTIONAL: Additional Evaluator Providers
# ================================================
#
# Install more evaluators: ./scripts/project install-evaluators
# Then set keys for providers you want to use:
#
# GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key-here
# MISTRAL_API_KEY=your-mistral-api-key-here
#
# ================================================
# SECURITY NOTE
# ================================================
#
# This file (.env) is automatically added to .gitignore.
# Your API keys will NOT be committed to git.
# Never share this file or commit it to version control.
#
